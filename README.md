## Project Description:
The project involves the development of a trading app using JavaScript, Node.js (Express.js), Ejs, MySQL, and CSS (SCSS). The primary goal of this project is to create a platform that facilitates trading activities for its users. The app is designed to have three types of users: clients, sub-admins, and admins.
Clients are able to register on the app and perform various actions such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and referring others to the platform. These functionalities enable clients to actively participate in trading activities and manage their financial transactions effectively. The app ensures a user-friendly interface for clients, making it intuitive and easy to navigate.
Sub-admins have additional responsibilities and privileges compared to clients. They can access various features such as viewing bank information, managing deposit requests, managing withdrawal requests, managing referral requests, viewing client details, and reviewing feedback provided by users. These additional functionalities empower sub-admins to oversee and manage different aspects of the trading app efficiently.
Admins have the highest level of control and authority within the app. They possess comprehensive management capabilities, including overseeing the entire banking system, managing deposits, managing withdrawals, managing referrals, managing client accounts, and addressing user feedback. Admins play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and smooth functioning of the trading app.
Throughout the development process, the project will utilize JavaScript as the primary programming language, with Node.js and Express.js providing the framework for server-side development. Ejs will be used for efficient rendering of dynamic web pages, while MySQL will serve as the database management system. CSS (specifically SCSS) will be employed to enhance the visual appeal and styling of the app.

## Project Outcomes:
- Development of a fully functional trading app that supports user registration, fund deposits, withdrawals, and referral systems.
- Implementation of role-based access control, enabling different levels of privileges and responsibilities for clients, sub-admins, and admins.
- Integration of banking functionalities, including managing deposit requests, withdrawal requests, and referral requests.
- Creation of user-friendly interfaces for clients, sub-admins, and admins, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- Successful utilization of JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Ejs, MySQL, and CSS (SCSS) in the development process.
- Robust database management utilizing MySQL to store and retrieve user information, banking details, and feedback data.
- Implementation of secure and reliable transactional functionalities to ensure the safety and integrity of financial transactions.
- Efficient handling and management of user feedback, providing admins with the necessary tools to address user concerns and improve the app's functionality.
